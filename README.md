# Pneumonia Detection From Chest X-Rays

In this project, I will analyze data from the NIH Chest X-ray Dataset and train a CNN to classify a given chest x-ray for the presence or absence of pneumonia. This project will culminate in a model that aims to predict the presence of pneumonia with human radiologist-level accuracy that can be prepared for submission to the FDA for 510(k) clearance as software as a medical device. As part of the submission preparation, I will formally describe my model, the data that it was trained on, and a validation plan that meets FDA criteria.

The project uses a dataset of 112,000 chest x-rays with disease labels acquired from 30,000 patients.
